								This website is a collaborative work of three graduate students of Simon Fraser University, Canada as a part of their course project named "Special Topics in Databases: Crowdsourcing". This interesting course was taught by Dr. Jiannan Wang <a href=" https://www.sfu.ca/computing/people/faculty/jiannanwang.html">(Profile) </a>  who joined SFU as an Assistant Professor in 2016 after completing his PostDoc from UC Berkeley. In the last five years Dr. Jiannan Wang had had a good number of publications in Crowdsourcing and he takes immense interest in passing his knowledge to his students. Following is a brief profile of these students who were a part of this project. </a>
